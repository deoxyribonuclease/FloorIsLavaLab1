Added several sounds and scripts:
1. Background music.
2. Sounds to moving objects.
3. Script "TouchEvent" that plays a sound when the player touches the object.
4. Script "BallBounceEvent" that plays the sound of the ball hitting the surfaces 
(Used attributes to separate the parameters, and used the ternary operator to determine whether the ball hit is strong enough to play the sound).
